\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
  
The purpose for this document is to provide the basic requirements for a software application that helps user simulate hairstyles and hair colors virtually. It should include the essential functional requirements, which specify the behavioral capability of the system, as well as the non-functional requirements in order to create a successful and robust application. \\
\newline
\noindent
This document should also act like an agreement between the stakeholders and the developers that the design should be based on the critical information provided in this document. The requirements should be the guiding principles in the design phase to guarantee that all the requirements are met. \\
\newline
The template for this document is a modified version 
of the Volere template (\textcolor{blue}{RobertsonAndRobertson2012}).

\subsection{Stakeholders}
\subsubsection{User}
\item People who have the demand to change their hair style and see how other hairstyles and different hair colors match their appearance virtually are welcome to explore in this iOS application.

\subsubsection{Client}

The clients for this project with be the students from the capstone course. These individuals will review and test the software before being deployed to the general public. In addition, the teach assistants and the supervisor will be actively involved throughout
the construction of this project.

\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
Other stakeholder could be the hair dressers and barbers. They can provide this app for their customer to help making a hairstyle decision.

\subsubsection{User Characteristics}
The identified users of the project can be categorized into 2 distinct groups. These groups are differentiated based on their varying background, experience of the user and their intended use(s) of the system. They are classified as the novice user and administrative user. \\
\newline
\noindent
It is assumed that all system users have experience operating with iOS applications. More specifically, all users are assumed to have experience working with iPhone, iOS 14, and above. They have been exposed to the camera app and most common icons by Apple.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Novice User: The application requires no prior training, and it is meant for the public, so all non-administrative users are novice users. Their intention is to use the application to simulate hairstyles and hair colors virtually. Anyone who does not have optic disabilities and other physical disabilities that make them unable to use the application on a smartphone can use the application.
    \item Administrative User: Their intention is not to use the application to simulate hairstyles, but to calibrate, configure, and maintain the application to make sure it functions properly and to its maximal capabilities. They wish to fix bugs, maintain database, and implement new features. They have a basic knowledge of computers, data management and app development.

\section{Functional Requirements}
\subsection{The Scope of the Work}
Many people wonder how a different hairstyle would look on them in real life. Most of them rely on their imagination and feelings, and some uses some applications with simple filters. Thus, the existing market lacks mobile applications that accurately simulate their look with a new hairstyle or color.

\subsection{Functional Requirements }
\subsubsection{Facial Recognition System}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[FR\refstepcounter{frreqnum}\thefrreqnum \label{R_Inputs}:] The user must input their face in image or video format
        \item[FR\refstepcounter{frreqnum}\thefrreqnum \label{R_Inputs}:] The system must pre-process the image by transforming the input facial image to grayscale
        \item[] Rationale: Increase the contrastness of the image to better detect the edges
        \item[] Math Specification: newImage $:=$ process($image$) $\Rightarrow$ ($\forall p :$ Pixels in image $|$ p[$Red$]*0.21 + p[$Green$]*0.72 + p[$Blue$]*0.07)
        \item[FR\refstepcounter{frreqnum}\thefrreqnum \label{R_Inputs}:] The system must perform face shape detection on grayscale facial image
        \item[] Rationale: The pre-trained facial detection model needs a grayscale image as an input to provide a more accurate result
        \item[FR\refstepcounter{frreqnum}\thefrreqnum \label{R_Inputs}:] The system must perform hair extraction on pre-processed image.
        \item[] Rationale: The pre-trained hair detection model needs a grayscale image as an input to provide a more accurate result
        \item[FR\refstepcounter{frreqnum}\thefrreqnum \label{R_Inputs}:] The system compute the hair edge coordinates
        \item[] Rationale: the pre-trained models will compute a series of important coordinates related to the hair. These coordinates will be used for various transformation.
        \item[FR\refstepcounter{frreqnum}\thefrreqnum \label{R_Inputs}:] The system must mark the corners and shape with facial landmark coordinates.
        \item[] Rationale: Marking the boundary is important, because the transformations will only apply to the hair not the face.
        \item[FR\refstepcounter{frreqnum}\thefrreqnum \label{R_Inputs}:] The system must store the coordinates from the hair and facial features.
    \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Hair Modification System}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[HM\refstepcounter{hmreqnum}\thehmreqnum \label{R_Inputs}:] The user must choose a color from the provided options if hair color transformation is selected
        \item[HM\refstepcounter{hmreqnum}\thehmreqnum \label{R_Inputs}:] The system must load the hair feature data for hair color transition
        \item[HM\refstepcounter{hmreqnum}\thehmreqnum \label{R_Inputs}:] The system should map the hair coordinates on the image and apply the new rgb values to the region
        \item[] Rationale: The hair coordinates are retrieved from facial recognition system, so new rgb colors can be applied to those regions
        \item[HM\refstepcounter{hmreqnum}\thehmreqnum \label{R_Inputs}:] The system must load the facial coordinates for hair style transformation
        \item[HM\refstepcounter{hmreqnum}\thehmreqnum \label{R_Inputs}:] The user must choose a hair style from the provided options if hair style transformation is selected
        \item[HM\refstepcounter{hmreqnum}\thehmreqnum \label{R_Inputs}:] The system should load the selected hair style dataset from the database
        \item[HM\refstepcounter{hmreqnum}\thehmreqnum \label{R_Inputs}:] the system should adjust the coordinate to be proportional with the image scale
        \item[HM\refstepcounter{hmreqnum}\thehmreqnum \label{R_Inputs}:] The system should add the new hair style coordinates above the facial coordinates.
        \item[] Rationale: depends on the hair style, some can be placed on top of the existing hair style, or re-construct
        \item[HM\refstepcounter{hmreqnum}\thehmreqnum \label{R_Inputs}:] The system should output the transformed face in image or video.
    \end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Hair Salon Recommendation System}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[HR\refstepcounter{hrreqnum}\thehrreqnum \label{R_Inputs}:] The user must enter a address or turn on current location to use the recommendation system
        \item[HR\refstepcounter{hrreqnum}\thehrreqnum \label{R_Inputs}:] The system must retrieve 5 nearby hair salon locations based on the input address
        \item[HR\refstepcounter{hrreqnum}\thehrreqnum \label{R_Inputs}:] The system should label the retrieved locations on a map
        \item[] Rationale: marking the locations on the map allows the user to see the distance to their current location visually
        \item[HR\refstepcounter{hrreqnum}\thehrreqnum \label{R_Inputs}:] The system should rank the locations based on user review
        \item[] Rationale: the user reviews is a good indicator for deciding which one to go to
    \end{itemize}
    
\subsubsection{\sout{Authentication System}}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[AR\refstepcounter{arreqnum}\thearreqnum \label{R_Inputs}:] \sout{The user must enter valid username and password to access their profile in the system}
        \item[AR\refstepcounter{arreqnum}\thearreqnum \label{R_Inputs}:] \sout{The system must allow the user to upload their face image before and after hair transformation}
        \item[] \sout{Rationale: users might want to save the images for future references}
        \item[AR\refstepcounter{arreqnum}\thearreqnum \label{R_Inputs}:] \sout{The system shall upload images after successful log in}
        \item[AR\refstepcounter{arreqnum}\thearreqnum \label{R_Inputs}:] \sout{The system must allow the user to log out}
    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\section{Unlikely Changes}    

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[ULC\refstepcounter{ulcnum}\theulcnum\label{ULC_meaningfulLabel}:] 
Since several of the features might require exposing API endpoints, an offline-only version of the application is unlikely to be necessary. 
\item[ULC\refstepcounter{ulcnum}\theulcnum\label{ULC_meaningfulLabel}:] 
As the main demographic of this application is less computer literate, the ease of use of this application must remain a high priority consideration throughout the design of this system.
\item[ULC\refstepcounter{ulcnum}\theulcnum\label{ULC_meaningfulLabel}:] 
The application is designed to ensure that data will only be modified when necessary. 
\item[ULC\refstepcounter{ulcnum}\theulcnum\label{ULC_meaningfulLabel}:]

\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues}
One of the issues is that the team does not have sufficient background knowledge in technologies we are going to use: AR, Computer Vision, and iOS development. Developers must learn these technologies before implementation of the application.


\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
Until now, there are a few similar open source projects online for us to go through. Since they are all written in different coding styles and design structures, we will only be gathering the basic concepts from these projects. Besides, to ensure that everyone in our team will be at the same pace and participate in the actual project, everyone in our team will take some time to play around with ARkit and swift before getting our hands on the actual design.

\subsection{New Problems}
\subsubsection{Effects on current environment}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The application will occupy the camera of the iOS mobile system when the application runs, and other applications in the same system can not use the camera function during this time.
    \item The application will occupy some memory in the iOS mobile system for it to run.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Potential User Problem}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Since pictures of users' faces will be saved in the system database,
    any potential data breach will exposes user privacy. 
    \item If the user uses the application under strong sunlight or in a dark environment, the user can potentially damage the eyes.
    \item If the user uses the application when crossing traffics, there is a potential of traffic accident.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Limitations in the Anticipated Implementation Environment That May Inhibit the New Product}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The back-end server may not be powerful enough to handle high volume of requests from users.
    \item The size of the application may be too large to install in a normal iOS mobile.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Follow-Up Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Will we create a demand for our product that we are not able to service?
    \item Will the new system cause us to run afoul of laws that do not currently apply?
    \item Will the existing hardware on users' iOS mobile cope?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
N/A

\subsection{Risks}
Some of the testing process will be difficult to automate, since the product will need actual human to judge whether the hairstyle fits smoothly on the 3D model. For this part of the testing, we will draw random samples and ask people around us to perform physical testing.

\subsection{Costs}

Other than the time it takes to develop the application there might be a cost for using some licensed libraries. 

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
\subsubsection{User Documentation Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A readme file will be provided in the documentation for user to read. The file will provide a full guideline of how to install and use our application.
    \item A technical specification will be provided for other developers who would like to make further changes to our application.
    \item The guideline will also be available on the help page of the running application.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Training Requirements}
N/A

\subsection{Waiting Room}

The application shall allow users to cut and make changes to their hairstyles, in order to enhance user experiences.

\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Add function in computer vision to capture user hand gestures, with the specific gesture motion on a specific area of hair, the hair beneath the hand will be cut.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain-specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.\\ \\
  Upon completing your project, all members will learn more about writing software development documentation and prototype presentation. In this project, ARkit is a new tool for everyone. As a result, after completing this project, we all should be familiar with the technical knowledge which can help us to build more AR-related applications. 
  
  Although Charlotte and Senni had some prior experience with swift, this project will be their first time developing a serious iOS application, not only will they have the opportunity to implement application UI/UX, but they will also learn more about swift which will help them gain insights about iOS/mobile application development. Although Jack had some experience with database development, such as using SQL and MATLAB, this is the first time he take the challenge to deal with project-related data. For sure he will also become better at data processing after this project. Last but not least, Marlon, Hongwei and Bill will be the pioneers to adventure machine learning using OpenCV with regard to facial recognition detection. They will learn about many machine learning concepts. During the whole development, all team members will also share their knowledge about the new technology they have learnt to help each other become better engineers, and also the things they already know to help each other during the development. Besides, all members will practice the design pattern we have learned in previous years and improve our leadership, communication and cooperation skills.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item For swift programming learning. The first approach will be gathering information from a book called "Develop In Swift". And applying the knowledge they learned to our project will help them to master Swift. The second approach would be from the other team members who had some knowledge about it. In this way, Senni and Charlotte will get familiar with the basic syntax in a short time. 
  \item For database developing, Jack will be adventuring pandas from python and following the tutorial online to learn the basic functions of it. After that, he will also learn from the actual developing process to put the knowledge into physical development.
  \item For back end and AR developers, they will first go through a few examples on github to get the basic concept about how to use a machine learning model. And then during the actual project building, they will also learn along the development and gather all the information needed to build a successful AR platform. 
  \item For teamwork skills mentioned above, we will first take turns to be the leader and host the weekly meetings during the development. Besides, we will also follow an agile standard during the development to enhance our teamwork and cooperation skills.
