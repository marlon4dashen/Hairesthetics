This document will provide the testing plan for Hairesthetics, including verification and validation Plan of SRS, design, and implementation, as well as system tests ranging from functional requirements tests to unit tests. It will also act as an outline of testing methods and outline the tools that will be utilized.

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}


  The software application Hairesthetics will be tested. Its functionality includes facial recognition, 3D hair modification, hair salon recommendation and authentication System.

\subsection{Objectives}

The objective for testing this project is to build confidence in the software correctness and demonstrate
safety of data, efficient execution, and adequate usability. 

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

Relevant documentation includes \textit{SRS}, \textit{HA} and \textit{MG}.

\section{Plan}

This section will provide the verification and validation plan of SRS, design, and implementation as well as tools that will be used for Verification and Automated Testing.
  

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

\noindent
Everyone on the team shares a role in the verification and validation process.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bill Song and Marlon Liu - Responsible for backend API testing and system integration testing
    \item Charlotte Cheng and Senni Tan - Responsible for frontend interface test
    \item Qiushi Xu and Hongwei Niu - Responsible for AR related testing. 
\end{itemize} 

 

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

 
\noindent
Our SRS would be verified through getting ad hoc feedback from our classmates and TAs. Since the team that reviewed The plan and TA had knowledge on our SRS, our plan is to ask them to explore our application with improvisation and ensure that they cover every possible functionality covered in our SRS. They can use their own ways to try to explore the extent of each features provided in our application and find possible behavioral bugs. 

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

Design will be verified by teammates, classmates and stakeholders. A checklist will be created to ensure the success of design in terms of the ability to meet the requirements and potential to satisfy stretch goals. Design is verified if the actual design output is the same as expected design output which satisfies the specifications of the product. The following checklist is composed of questions with regard to the design of the project.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Did you design the product right?
    \item Did you design the right product?
    \item Can users accomplish their goals and tasks with the application?
    \item Is the design effective?
    \item Does the design provide good utility?
    \item Does the design's actual output match the expected output?
\end{itemize}




\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}



\noindent
The verification and validation plan will be verified by a group of our classmates and TAs where they will be asked to perform a walk-through of the document to ensure that our test plan is complete and effective. Any feedback will be accepted and changes will be made to address those reviews.

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

  
The functionality and performance of our code implementation will be mostly verified through our system testing. It will ensure our application performs all the specified tasks as expected. Additionally, a part of the NFRs are also validated by the system tests. Our unit test are designed to take care of each individual module by assessing their quality using stubs or drivers. And it also evaluates the details of each module by providing test case for each function.\\
\noindent
Our implementation would also require static verification. The method is decided to have classmates and TA perform code inspection to our source code. This can help reveal any code styling issue and potential logical errors in our implementation.

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

The following tools will be used for automated testing:

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{The verification tools used in each module/section}
\end{table}

\newpage

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

No external data will be used for validation, therefore no plans are formulated for it.\\
\\
\noindent Review sessions will be conducted with the stakeholders to check that the requirements document fully capture the right requirements. For this purpose, a task-based walkthrough will serve as the validation. Users of the system were already identified in SRS along with a set of real-world tasks that they complete using the system. These tasks must mirror what users actually do in their environment but not how they do it. These tasks must be very specific and they must be complete. This information was gathered by observing the actual target users using the application in their environment, team 18 came up with a list of target users and realistic tasks. The combination of a user and their corresponding task descriptions is called a scenario and the goal is to tell a complete story.
With a manageable list of scenarios in place from SRS, a task-based walkthrough of the system can be performed by teammates and stakeholders. A scenario will be selected and participants will
place themselves in the mind of their target user and stay on track with what that user is trying to accomplish during the scenario.

The pytest framework will be used as unit testing too for this project. In unit testing, each “unit” of our code is tested as fully as possible, as an isolated chunk of code. A “unit” stands for a function or a method in our system.


\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}
Unit tests are narrow in scope, and allow us to cover all cases, ensuring that every single part works correctly. Unit testing typically have to test every function, method, object or component in our design. In our application, unit testing should mainly focus on testing the accuracy of the AR output on face capture through camera, which will compare the similarity of expected look with the actual look. Additionally, other compatible components need to be tested as well. In order to make single unit test pass and achieve a high coverage rate, we will use test coverage metrics to measure and monitor the testing activity\\



\newline Modules outside of the scope:
\begin{itemize}
    \item It interact with the database
    \item It uses interface through the network
    \item It communicates with the file system
    \item It cannot be ran automatically using the unit testing tool with other unit tests at the same time
    \item It needs mandatory operations (like modify makefile, configfile, environment variables) to run it
\end{itemize}\\

More specifically, most of the non-functional requirements cannot be verified by unit testing. Non-functional tests are mostly categorized as a performance test and cannot be tested quantitatively.

\section{Appendix}

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the test cases will call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.
\subsection{Usability Research Plan}
For our project, the interface and user experience would be very important. In order to conduct the best user friendly application, we decides to make a user research by two methods. First of all, we are planning to prepare a usability survey and make small interviews with users interested in such apps. Buy gathering suggestions from public we can make small changes to make our product easier to use. Besides, we are also planing to ask guests to test use our application and gain useful feed backs once it is implemented. By making small changes accordingly before submitting may improve the usability experience significantly.
\subsection{Usability Survey Questions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Would you prefer to have a tutorial of our application by text or video?
    \item Would you prefer to have all the features hidden or present when virtually presenting the hairstyle?
    \item Would you prefer to have cartoon style interface or modern style interface? 
\end{itemize}


\newpage{}
\subsection{Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
  Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge,
  static testing knowledge, specific tool usage etc.  You should look to
  identify at least one item for each team member.
  
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Senni}
More knowledge on dynamic testing will be acquired for the team to successfully complete the verification and validation of the project. In the system test for nonfuncational requirement, most of the tests are plan to be done by the user and gathering feedback from the user survey, a more generic approach or a more generic measure tool or methods are required to give a more thorough test.\\
\newline
To acquire the knowledge of better testing nonfunctional requirements, there are two approaches: 1. do research on any measurement tools for dynamic testing 2. interview with experienced senior developer in the industry or project manager in the industry to learn more knowledge about testing nonfunctional requirements with dynamic testing. After discussion, we decided to take the second approach because measurement tools for dynamically testing nonfunctional requirement is very rare in the current industry, and all members had connections to senior developers or managers in the software industry, and thus it will be a good way to interview with the seniors and learn more about testing for nonfunctional requirement in dynamic testing.

\subsubsection{Bill}
I am responsible for conducting verification and validation of the functional testing in our project. On the back-end side of our application, the team chose to use a testing framework called Pytest. However, I am not familiar with this tool, I need to acquire more knowledge and information regarding to Pytest's testing structure and syntax. For example, ways of unit testing, integration testing, and code coverage analysis using Pytest. In addition, more of the testings are related to image processing and transformation, I need to learn how to conduct these test efficiently.\\
\newline
The first action I would take is to talk to professionals and friends who have extensive experiences in testing image processing and transformation. I want to formulate some ideas and strategies, then try to apply them using Pytest. This method would be time-efficient, since they gave me a general direction on testing based on their professional experiences. The second approach is looking at information available online, some resources provide useful information and solutions to specific domains I might encounter.
\medskip

\subsubsection{Jack}
In this document, I am mainly responsible for provide tests method for some of the non-functional requirements and also conclude all the tests method into a tractability matrix. For non-functional requirements, the tests mostly reply on manual and user input. Our team needs to conduct physical tests to ensure that the application meets all the requirements. Besides, I have also added a matrix to trace which test can ensure which requirements.\\

\newline
There are a few knowledge I need to learn before the actual testing begin. First of all, we need to come up with a plan to conduct these tests effectively. For example, finding suitable people to test our app after it is being developed. Secondly, I will be coffee talking to other project managers and learn about their non-functional requirements testing procedures. Last but not least, I will also go through some testing reports on the open source projects on GitHub to gain more knowledge about testing methods.




\subsubsection{Charlotte}
For this VnV plan, I learnt that in software testing, verification and validation (V&V) is the process of checking that a software system meets specifications and requirements so that it fulfills its intended purpose. It may also be referred to as software quality control. It is normally the responsibility of software testers as part of the software development lifecycle. In simple terms, software verification is: "Assuming we should build X, does our software achieve its goals without any bugs or gaps?" On the other hand, software validation is: "Was X what we should have built? Does X meet the high-level requirements?".\\

Verification and validation are not the same things, although they are often confused. Verification is asking the question: Are we building the product right?
Validation is asking the question: Are we building the right product? "Building the product right" checks that the specifications are correctly implemented by the system while "building the right product" refers back to the user's needs. In some contexts, it is required to have written requirements for both as well as formal procedures or protocols for determining compliance. 
\newline

\subsubsection{Marlon}
During the development of the VnV plan, I was responsible for coming up with the verification plan. One  message I learnt is the importance of getting reviews from people other than the development group, which also reflects the needs for roles like software engineer in testing in the industry. During the software development life cycle, the developers usually strictly follow the development plan and ideas when contributing to a grand software. Thus, it's hard for them to jump out of the box and realize their mistakes through their development process. Additionally, all the documents are required to be inspected as well in case any ignorance causing problems forming in the early stages. 

The process also rings a bell for me to start learning testing frameworks required when creating automation for my assigned parts in the project. I will be accompany with Bill to test the backend API and algorithm. One important tool used for testing API is Postman. I will need to learn how to integrate it into part of the pytest framework. The best way to learn how to set up the testing automation properly is to consult someone with QA experiences, such as colleagues from our group during my internship. It will also help to start some research online since I already have some experiences working with both postman and pytest.

\subsubsection{Hongwei}
Based on development of this document, I learned Verification process (static testing) includes checking documents, design, code, and program, whereas Validation process (dynamic testing) includes testing and validation of the actual product. For example, Dynamic testing contains the steps of Test case design, Test environment step-up, Test case execution, Test analysis and evaluation, Bug Reporting. More specifically, in the hierarchy of Dynamic testing - Black-box testing - Functional testing, there are Unit testing, Integration testing, System testing, User acceptance testing. In unit testing, we will be using pytest to test each component in our design.\\
\newline
Two possible approaches to acquring related knowledge and get hands-on experience with the tool: First, do research on pytest.org and other open-source community, run and understand examples, try to integrate our design into pytest. Secondly, talk to friends and former colleagues who has related experience. After analysing pros and cons of both methods, we choose to use the second one, since there is a limitation in online resources and the teammate (Marlon) who work with me has industrial-level experience in pytest.
