\section{Introduction}

This document provides the hazard analysis of the Hairesthetics application. Hairesthetics is an application that simulates 3D hairstyles. The definition of a hazard used throughout this document is based on Nancy Leveson's work. A hazard is any property or condition of Hairesthetics that has the potential to result in a loss in the system when paired with a condition in the environment. In Hairesthetics, there are hazards in safety (storing data), and security (restricting access to data). 

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}
The scope of this document is to state any critical assumptions about the project, as well as to identify possible hazards within the system components, the effects and causes of failures, mitigation steps, and resulting safety and security requirements.

\section{System Boundaries and Components}
The system referred to in this document that the hazard analysis will be conducted on consists of:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The iOS application installed on user devices, including both the front-end and back-end made up of the following four major components:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Facial Recognition System
        \item Hair Modification System
        \item Hair Salon Recommendation System
        \item Authentication System       
    \end{itemize}
    \item User Device, iPhone
    \item \sout{MongoDB database where all data will be stored}
    \item \sout{Cloud database backup programs}
\end{enumerate}

\noindent The system boundary in this case includes the entire application, user device, \sout{the database, and the data backup program.} The user device and cloud hosting, hardware, \sout{and down-time of the database} are elements that are not controlled by this project. The user device is controlled by the user \sout{and portions of the database are controlled by MongoDB}. However, they are still critical elements of the system and were thus included in this hazard analysis.

\section{Critical Assumptions}
The application will be tested on Apple-provided iPhone simulators as well as developers' devices (iOS 14 and above). It is assumed that all physical devices are in good condition to be used for the project and if the application is compatible with Apple-provided iPhone simulators, then it is compatible and functions properly on actual iPhones with iOS 14 and above.\\
\\
\noindent The scope and specifications of the project will not change when the project takes place. However, when conducting the project, there might be cases where the scope and specifications need to be altered to cater to clients' requirements and needs of the project.\\
\\
\noindent \sout{The data will be automatically updated in the database, and all information in the database is synchronized.}


\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}
\subsection{Hazards out of scope}
The out of scope hazards falls into the following categories:
\begin{itemize}
    \item User's Camera
    \item User's mobile phone hardware
    \item ArKit library
\end{itemize}
User side's hardware conditions is something that the team does not have control over. Besides, the ArKit library is also out of the scope since it is a third party library. The hazards can not be handled completely through our development, however we will try our best to minimize them.
\subsection{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis Table}
The failure modes \& effects analysis (FMEA) was chosen as a tool to identify and analyze the hazards within the system so that requirements can be made to mitigate them.

\section{Roadmap}

The hazard analysis resulted in new safety and security requirements given in section above. A number of the requirements will be implemented within the capstone timeline such as ACR1, ACR3, IR1, IR2, IR4, PRR1, PRR2, PRR3, AUR1. However, some of them will not, due to project time constraints, such as ACR2, ACR4, IR3, IR5. These will be implemented in the future. Towards the end of the project, the hazard analysis will be consulted to gain an understanding of which risks have been successfully mitigated and which one sill require work.
